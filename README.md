## Introduction

This obsidian plugin is for converting your notes in CSV  format to an Obsidian file, as well it now supports "My Clipplings.txt". If you have no idea how to get your notes, [go here](https://medium.com/@keisuke_w/how-to-export-kindle-notes-and-highlights-ebce5812bbfc#55d8), the article explains how to obtain both formats.

The existence of this plugin is only for converting CSV and My Clippings with desired format easily, while not having any Amazon Account linked to Obsidian. If you want to keep your highlights synced, use this [awesome plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Kindle%20Highlights).


## Considerations & Limitations

"My Clippings.txt" is a sensitive file, it doesn't remove the highlights, just appends them, which means if you remove a highlight, it will still be available in the file. This plugin helps to clean up the duplicates, but may accidentally delete some. Again, it's limited, you may experience *You have reached the clipping limit for this item*, but this can be fixed by removing the [DRM](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/remove-drm-every-ebook-own/) is a perfectly legal approach when used __ONLY__ for personal use.

> While you can, use the CSV formatting.
